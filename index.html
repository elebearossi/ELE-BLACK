				<h2>MERCURY</h2>
				Mercury is the closest planet to the sun. It rotates slowly and It is the smallest planet in the solar system. It has no moons, no rings, and an atmosphere so thin that scientists classify it as an exosphere.

				<h2>VENUS</h2>
				Venus is slightly smaller than Earth. Because of its relative proximity to Earth, it is the largest planet seen in the night sky.  The density of its atmosphere makes the air pressure at the surface 90 times that of Earth's. The heat and pressure make the planet decidedly inhospitable to life.

			<div class="content"><h2>EARTH</h2>Earth, the third planet from the sun and the largest terrestrial planet, is the only planet known to host living beings and the only one known to have liquid water on its surface. The atmosphere is crucial to Earth's ability to support life. The surface of the earth is mostly water.</div>

		<div class=infoBox id="MarsInfo" style = "display:none" ><div class="content"> <h2>MARS</h2>The red color of the surface comes from iron oxide or rust in the soil. Mars experiences frequent planet-wide wind storms. Some of the surface features of Mars hint to the possibility that water previously existed on the planet and may still flow under the surface. </div>

		<div class=infoBox id="JupiterInfo" style = "display:none" > <div class="content"><h2>JUPITER</h2> Is the first of the gas giant planets. Its characteristic colored cloud patterns are caused by enormous, swirling storms in its atmosphere. The largest and most distinctive of the storms, the Great Red Spot, is larger than Earth. Jupiter has 63 moons and a faint ring system.</div>

The rings orbit the planet in a thin band about a mile thick. The interior of Saturn, like Jupiter, is made of mostly hydrogen and helium. </div>

This cold planet is four times the size of Earth and it has a faint ring system and 27 moons in its orbit.</div>

		<div class=infoBox id="NeptuneInfo" style = "display:none" > <div class="content"> <h2>NEPTUNE</h2>The blue planet Neptune is a very cold place. Because of its distance from the sun and its large orbit, one year on Neptune is 165 Earth years. Like all the outer planets, Neptune, like Uranus, has a diameter roughly four times that of Earth.</div>
